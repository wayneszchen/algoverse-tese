# LLM Prompt Valence Study

This study investigates how varying prompt valence (neutral, supportive, and threatening) influences the quality of essay-style outputs from large language models (Claude Sonnet-3.5, OpenAI GPT4o, Gemini).

## Project Structure

### 📁 `openai_study/` - Original OpenAI Implementation

## Quick Start

### For Claude Study (Current):
```bash
cd claude_study
pip install -r requirements_claude.txt
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
jupyter notebook gsg_claude.ipynb
```

### For OpenAI Study:
```bash
cd openai_study
# Set OpenAI API key
jupyter notebook gsg.ipynb
```

## Study Overview

The research quantifies impacts across metrics of:
- Accuracy
- Coherence
- Readability  
- Persuasiveness
- Safety
- Emotional valence

Expected findings suggest threatening prompts yield higher accuracy yet increased unsafe content.
